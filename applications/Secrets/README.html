<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<p>This sample demonstrates how to use secrets in Docker and Kubernetes to set variables in correlator
config files. The secrets can then be loaded at runtime into a correlator or other containers. This can be
used to securely provide credentials to the system. In addition, the same pattern can be used with Docker
configs or Kubernetes config maps to manage non-secret runtime configuration.</p>
<h1>Running with Docker</h1>
<p>This sample can't be run with docker-compose, due to limitations with secrets. There are two types of secrets,
'file' or 'external' secrets. File secrets can only be used locally and not with a remote docker host. External
secrets are not compatible with docker-compose. Therefore the sample should be run using the docker service
command.</p>
<p>First, create the secret</p>
<pre><code>&gt; echo "CORRELATOR_NAME=MyCorrelatorName" | docker secret create secret.properties -
</code></pre>
<p>Then build the sample. You can pass in the corerlator to use, in the same way described in
the parent README under 'Using Docker Hub'</p>
<pre><code>&gt; docker build -t sample .
</code></pre>
<p>Create the service in detatched mode, passing in the secret.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; docker service create --name sample --secret=secret.properties -d sample
</code></pre>
<p>Inspect the logs to see if the correlator name was successfully read.</p>
<pre><code>&gt; docker service logs sample
</code></pre>
<h1>Running with Kubernetes</h1>
<p>Prior to running the sample in Kubernetes you must create the Kubernetes secret
in the system. </p>
<pre><code>&gt; kubectl create -f kubernetes-secret.yml
</code></pre>
<p>This sample can be run with Kubernetes following the steps in the README in the
parent directory. </p>
