Simple
======
This sample is a very simple application, deploying a trivial EPL program into
a running correlator. A container runs the correlator and then runs the client
tools to deploys the program.

Detailed instructions on running a Compose-based application can be found in
the README in the parent directory.

After bringing this sample up, you should notice the log from the correlator
container telling you "Hello world!".
