<h1>Use UM for communication between two Apama correlators</h1>
<p>This sample demonstrates two Apama correlators communicating with each other
via a UM realm server, all in separate containers. It uses Docker Stack,
configured via 'docker-compose.yml' in this directory.</p>
<h2>BEFORE YOU START</h2>
<p>The Sample requires a base image for Apama and Universal Messaging. You have
several options for Apama and these are detailed below.</p>
<p>To ensure that the environment is configured correctly for Apama, all the 
commands below should be executed from a shell where the Apama/bin/apama_env 
script has been sourced.</p>
<h3>Apama Base Images</h3>
<p>| Image                     |description                                                         |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Docker Hub                 | https://hub.docker.com/r/softwareag/apama-correlator-suite         |
|Existing Install           | use the docker packaging kit instructions to build a base image    |</p>
<p>If you are using the docker packaging kit from an existing install you will
need to create an Apama image which contains the required UM client libraries
for Apama/UM integration. Copy 'Dockerfile.apama_um_enabled' to the root
directory of your Universal Messaging installation (i.e.
'/opt/SoftwareAG/UniversalMessaging').</p>
<pre><code>&gt; docker build -f Dockerfile.apama_um_enabled -t apama_um_enabled .
</code></pre>
<p>Docker will then build a new Apama image 'apama_um_enabled', with the required
UM libraries. If you are using the official image from Docker Hub rather
than the enclosed packaging kit then you can skip this step.</p>
<p>The Universal Messaging images can be found below </p>

<h2>RUNNING THE SAMPLE</h2>
<h3>DOCKER:</h3>
<p>To run the sample on Linux:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Build the image for the Correlator, using the base Apama image:</p>
<pre><code>docker build -f Dockerfile.apama_app --tag correlator-image --build-arg APAMA_IMAGE=&lt;apama-image&gt; .
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now run the following command to start the Universal Messaging server from the base image</p>
<pre><code>UM_IMAGE=&lt;um-image&gt; docker stack deploy -c docker-compose-um.yml sample-um
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can confirm that the Universal Messaging server is successfully started by checking the following:</p>
<pre><code>docker service logs sample-um_umsample-acl
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the containers are running for Universal Messaging and there are no errors start the correlators:</p>
<pre><code>CORR_IMAGE=&lt;correlator-image&gt; EXTERNAL_NETWORK_PREFIX=sample-um docker stack deploy -c docker-compose-corr.yml sample-corr
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>View the events being received by the receiver correlator:</p>
<pre><code>docker service logs sample-corr_apamareceiver
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>KUBERNETES</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Build the image for the Correlator, using the base Apama image:</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that the image needs to be pushed to a repository so
 "correlator-image" should be in the form
 <strong>your-repository:correlator-image</strong></p>
<pre><code>docker build -f Dockerfile --tag correlator-image --build-arg APAMA_IMAGE=&lt;apama-image&gt; .
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The image built needs to be pushed into a repository for kubernetes to use:</p>
<pre><code>docker push **your-repository:correlator-image**
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next get kubernetes to run and set up the Universal Messaging server, first
    replace the image name in kubernetes-um.yml with the Universal Messaging
    image you are using, then run:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl create -f kubernetes-um.yml
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once UniversalMessaging has successfully started (kubectl get -f
    kubernetes-um.yml), run and set up the Correlators.  To do this, edit the
   file to replace the image with the correlator-image created:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl create -f kubernetes-corr.yml
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>View the events being received by the receiving correlator:</p>
<pre><code>kubectl logs umsample-receiver
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>After bringing the sample up, you can use 'docker service logs' or 'kubectl
logs umsample-receiver' to examine the logs from the 'apamareceiver' container. It will
contain messages similar to </p>
<pre><code>'SimpleEvent("The current epoch is 1436179491.8")'
</code></pre>
<p>which were sent by the correlator in the 'apamasender' container via the realm
server in the 'um' container.</p>
<p>You can view the networks created using:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; docker network ls
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to try out a more realistic multi-host deployment, you can explore
using Compose against Docker Swarm (https://docs.docker.com/swarm/), which
will automatically distribute the containers across a collection of
Docker-enabled hosts. If you want one or both of the Apama containers to be
deployed on a distinct host to the 'um' container, then comment out the overlay
driver key from the networks section.</p>
